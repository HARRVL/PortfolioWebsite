			"So, I cloned and customized this React app to showcase my coding projects; go check 'em out. I'm not very experienced with programming yet, but this is my shot at putting a little dent in the universe. I enjoy solving complex problems and learning new skills. I'm passionate about innovating, creating solutions, and automating tasks for users and myself. My goal is to one day create my own software company that provides users with innovations that will change their lives. Why the boat picture? I really want to have my own boat one day, and also, it looks sick.",

			"I'm currently a Computer Science student at Marquette University and complementing my major with a minor from the College of Business. My academic journey has always been fueled by my strengths in math and science. Originally, I began my college career majoring in Mechanical Engineering. However, as I explored the coursework, I felt it wasn't contemporary enough for my aspirations. My pivot towards Electrical Engineering was inspired by hands-on experiences with renewable energy systems alongside my father. Yet, it was a computer science course, embedded within the electrical engineering curriculum, that truly resonated with me. The contrast became even clearer during my other courses like circuits and fields, which didn't engage me as much. Last summer in 2023, I interned at a renewable energy engineering firm in Puerto Rico. Interestingly, I found myself gravitating towards coding and program writing during my free hours. This growing passion led me to dive deeper into the world of computer science, ultimately leading to a shift in my major. What intrigues me about CS is its vast application spectrum and the potential for remote work. Currently, I'm aiming for an internship position, preferably as a Software Engineer or Data Scientist, in a leading company where I can hone my skills for the future. Entrepreneurship has always been my endgame. My ambition is to harness my knowledge to forge a business centered around software and technology. However, life for me isn't just about professional achievements. Family, close friends, and quality time are what I cherish the most. Whether it's fishing on our family boat, beach outings, or simply working out, I believe in daily growth. To me, it's all about being 1% better every day; consistently progressing from yesterday to tomorrow.",
