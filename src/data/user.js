			"So, I cloned and customized this React app to showcase my coding projects; go check 'em out. I'm not very experienced with programming yet, but this is my shot at putting a little dent in the universe. I enjoy solving complex problems and learning new skills. I'm passionate about innovating, creating solutions, and automating tasks for users and myself. My goal is to one day create my own software company that provides users with innovations that will change their lives. Why the boat picture? I really want to have my own boat one day, and also, it looks sick.",
